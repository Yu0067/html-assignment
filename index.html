<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Deng Yu-Jyuan, I’m an international student from Taiwan, and I am currently in my first year of Interactive Media Design program in Algonquin College.</p> 
<p>I like digital art and music. Now my remote job is to do graphic design for a clothing brand. <strong>“Work hard and play hard”</strong>is my motivational quote.</P>
<P>I hope I can burn enthusiasm at work and enjoy life appropriately. </p>
<p>I applied for the Interactive Media Design program in Algonquin college because I wanted to improve my skills and English ability. It’s a special experience for me to be able to take classes online now. Although online classes can be borderless, I am also looking forward to coming to Canada next year.</p>
